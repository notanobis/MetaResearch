Framework should be minimal -- people have different styles, different experiences, different character traits. Minimalism paves the way for generality. Less constraints means less structure, which in turn allows you to be broad. Of course, lack of structure means lack of specificity; applicability and effectiveness are the two different ends of spectrum. But why should we strive for a generic system?
First, I believe that most of the seemingly significant hurdles we seek to overcome are secondary effects of a deep, systemic underlying root cause. I believe the overarching problem is linked to power relations. It then follows that we should try to address the problem at hand through a socioeconomics lens, and that necessitates a study of politics. There's no technical solution to a political problem. If we then seek to underscore the importance of politics, our value system itself must allow for the development of ideas through an epistemology with politics as its centerpiece. ...

One of the most exciting, critical and provocative perpectives on mental health. In this psychedelic facilitation training video "Collective Care", at the intersection of Healing, Psychedelics and Politics, Florie St. Aime show that healing may require changing our society, and not only oneself. Activism, organizing, collective care, political accountability and refusal to normalize oppression, are not an add-on to healing, but a core part of healing itself. Here are some quotes:

“What would happen if she had to be sober in this life? … Is it to make people feel good about the horrible conditions of their lives? Help them cope within cruel and unchanging circumstances?”
“It will take more than the two of us in a room to change the circumstances around their suffering.”
“The medical-industrial complex taught me that it was not just mental health professionals, it was whole industries working to make cruel conditions feel okay.”
“I had to understand colonization as a creator of this system and capitalization as its assistant.”
“The whole industry is within a system of domination.”
“The mental health industry has become an important fixture to maintaining normal.”
“Activism and organizing became a part of my clinical work.”
“At some point, getting clients to feel rage was the point of the work for me. I wanted to impress people to feel the rage of the conditions they have been forced to adapt to and organize, revolt, and start a revolution.”
“That became the goal of my therapy.”
“Collective care is recognizing that all beings are worthy of living without barrier and being with the reality that that’s not how it is.”
“When do we as clinicians decide to stop seeing people as individual failures and start seeing them as a symptom of a much larger issue?”
