- longtermism critic 
- Stallman responsibility because actions pressure others
- Beside the data flattening problem, this technology makes you work for it for free (who supplies the training data)
- Not only energy consumption but also the mining the people that carry the ores etc 
- Also data labeling, subemployment
- We should make sustainability and justice the goal behind every piece of tech we build -> link to poor craftsmanship and software decay
- long-term bad, short-term "good" so you fall behind -- there’s a problem when you’re under circumstances that force you to optimize for the very short term

Data labeling: basically slavery (jails and poor elderly in the global North, refugee camps in the global South)

Cost:
- monies
- power
- ores
- transport
- cancer

- Note that the most powerful people are often friends, or even relatives. The view that highly competent psychopaths rise to the top is misleading. This is also true on a smaller scale (e.g., Greece). Also note that if that's even partially the case, then the idea that we're fighting a faceless amorphous "system" serves as a great distraction
- How can we think that these people operate for the good on mankind? There's overwhelming evidence that suggests the exact opposite, both when examining their own past but also when examining the history of humanity and technological progress
- Doesn't this start to sound like conspiracy theory territory? Maybe, but remember: https://youtu.be/vDQn-AJUcY0?si=9RZTdGCes8ojUG47&t=2765



A recent example: [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/pull/2388). Just like the platforms mentioned in [[social-media]] (Poulis), these tools are quickly becoming a new platform, a platform for software, or broader yet, for interacting with the digital (for now) world. 


Security
[AI Agent, AI Spy](https://youtu.be/0ANECpNdt-4):
- No way for apps to win, if the os is not playing fair. And who owns the os? The same company that owns the Ai the same company that owns the cloud… again, a platform issue 
- The failure rates: even if you have very high accuracy for one step, you’ll still have huge failure rates for multi step tasks. You can’t deploy that on an enterprise level
- Why all the pressure? Why the reckless deployment? Because capex is way higher than revenue 
- Privacy issues: bypasses e2ee, and also collects even more data from you. More data, more ads, more conformism
- The computer was a well understood machine where the user acted on the machine. Now the machine becomes a black box acting on the user 
- Alignment issue, focus is on task completion instead of maintaining system integrity
- We don't understand any of this, we don't understand the implications, we don't understand how to address the tension between consent and agency. Yet there is no regulation in place to stop these people. Of course that's a more general point that goes beyond just security and privacy concerns

The DRAM shitshow:
- https://www.mooreslawisdead.com/post/sam-altman-s-dirty-dram-deal

Counterarguments:
- it's a tool, just like any other tool
- everyone is doing it, so don't feel bad for doing it too
- the expectations (exams, essays, work) have increased, because of the assumption that everyone is using it

[Risks from power-seeking AI systems](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/risks-from-power-seeking-ai/) seems very conveniently hollow, so we should wear our jazz hat and listen for the notes that aren't played

The million dollars question:
It is the first time my own experience and mental model about the world contradicts the claims of other people that much. Is there something I don't understand? Am I lying to myself? If not, why do people, from the technologically inept to PhDs and tech leads, try so hard to lie to themselves? Why are the poor, struggling to get by, living from paycheck to paycheck, so eager to defend their oppressors? Answering this question properly would require surveys, which is highly unlikely and prone to errors, but it's still worthwhile to try and answer, to understand what exactly contributes to the virility of this technology and economic model
